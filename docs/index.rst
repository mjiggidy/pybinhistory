pybinhistory
============
*Because* ``pybinlog`` *was takenâ„¢*

``pybinhistory`` is a pypi package for the :mod:`binhistory` python library.

:mod:`binhistory` is a python library for programmatically reading and writing Avid bin history log (``.log``) files in 
multi-user Avid Media Composer projects.

.. caution::

   :mod:`binhistory` is an unofficial library created for educational purposes.  While the ``.log`` file format 
   is a very simple one, it is officially undocumented. Use this library at your own risk -- the developer assumes 
   no responsibility for any damage to your project, loss of data, or weird snippy drama about who threw the audio 
   out of sync in the latest version of the reel.

About Avid bin logs
-------------------


An Avid bin log is a ``.log`` file that lives alongside an Avid bin (``.avb`` or ``.avs``) file in a multi-user 
Avid environment.  It maintains a history of the most recent modifications made to the contents of the bin.  Each time 
a user saves changes to a bin, its ``.log`` is updated with another entry.

By default, the log file contains a maximum of 10 log entries.  Each log entry contains:

- A timestamp of the modification
- The hostname of the system that made the modification
- The name of the user profile that made the modification

Here is an example ``.log`` file with the maximum 10 entries.  Hypothetically, if this were a log for an Avid bin 
called ``Sc 12.avb``, this log would live beside it as ``Sc 12.log``\.
